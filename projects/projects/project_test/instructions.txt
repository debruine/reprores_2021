=== Reproducible Report for test ===
  
Your questionnaire measures stress. Your research question is to determine if the stress score differs by condition for the subset of the sample where language is bilingual. In other words, if you just look at the participants for whom language is bilingual, what is the main effect of condition on the stress score?

There are 4 data files for the subjects. The name of the data file tells you what condition and version of the experiment the subjects were in. For example, the file "subjects_condition-A_version-V1.csv" contains the subjects who were in condition "A" and version "V1".

The 8 stress questionnaire items are on a scale from 1 (low) to 7 (high), but some of the items need to be reverse-coded. This is indicated by the letter R in the question column name. You create the stress score by summing the questions *after* reversing the relevant questions.

Watch out for missing data. Omit subjects who have missing values for any of the variables involved in your analysis, but not subjects who have other missing variables.

The report should be written like a summary document for your PI. You don't need to show your code in the rendered report. Include summary tables and/or plots with subject demographics from both the full data set and the subset you'll analyse. Visualise the relationship of interest. Conduct a GLM analysis to answer the research question above. Finally, do a power analysis to determine the sample size you would need to have 85% power to detect a 0.5-point difference between the levels of condition with an alpha criterion of 0.05.
